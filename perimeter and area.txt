//Write a C program to compute the perimeter and area of a rectangle with a height of 7 inches and width of 5 inches.
#include <stdio.h>

void main()

{

   int p,a;

   p=2*(7+5);

   printf(“Perimeter of the Rectangle is: %d units\n”,p);

   a=7*5;

   printf(“Area of the Rectangle is: %d square units\n”,a);

}

Output:

Perimeter of the Rectangle is: 24 units

Area of the Rectangle is: 35 square units
